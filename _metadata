As your universe will break when removing the mod from your list.[/h1]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/vUkZ8zk.png[/img]\n[h1]What is Starburst?[/h1]\nStarburst is a mod that aims to improve the game dramatically without losing the feel of Starbound itself. Reworking old and new content to fit into an improved framework and adding new content when needed. Making things more challenging, unique, and distinct. Explore a new cosmos that is more varied and vast than before, with many new hazards to overcome, and lots of unique things to find.\n\n[h1]How Do I Get Started[/h1]\nIt is recommended to start a new game and universe when starting the mod, but it will still work if you don't. Once you make it through your first planet, create a Hazard Lab Table to grant you items to survive on the newly overhauled planets. After that, well, continue onwards as you would normal Starbound.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/y9ceAoe.png[/img]\n[h1]New Hazard System[/h1]\nThe hazards on planets have been extremely overhauled, with new hazards, mild hazards, and new methods of staving them off. EPPs have been relegated to the end of a tier rather than the start. You can even try to survive by mitigating them or even going in without protection. Really makes you feel like you're conquering new worlds.\n\n[h2]New Hazards[/h2]\nMany hazards have been added to add in more of a difficulty curve. Mild versions of all hazards have been implemented to planets starting at Tier 3, easy to stave off. As well, 2 new hazard types have been added: Toxicity and Static. Both have unique ways of keeping you on your toes.\n\n[h2]Hazardous Weather[/h2]\nMany weather patterns have been changed and added to become hazardous. These weather patterns give you Mild versions of the hazards they belong to and start as early as Tier 2. They aren't too dangerous, they last only for a little while and taking shelter blocks them entirely without any hazard mitigation.\n\n[h2]New Mitigation Methods[/h2]\nWith the new Hazard Lab Table and its upgrade, you can obtain new Hazard Blocking consumables and augments. Consumables are what you start off with and only last a limited time before needing to be reapplied, Augments are permanent blockers but require something to install them on to work. EPPs have been reworked to be an end of tier addition and no longer block every hazard, just the one they're built for.\n\n[h1]New Progression System[/h1]\nProgression as a whole has been changed to a new mold, with new hazards, reworked stars, and planets shifted around to better fit each one. They follow a strict progression that helps build up difficulty as you progress through the game.\n[list]\n    [*][b]Tier 1-2[/b]\nGentle Stars\nNone/Hazardous Weather\n    [*][b]Tier 3[/b]\nTemperate Stars\nMild Hazards\n    [*][b]Tier 4[/b]\nHazardous Stars\nDeadly Toxicity and Radiation\n    [*][b]Tier 5[/b]\nChaotic Stars\nDeadly Heat, Cold, and Static\n    [*][b]Tier 6[/b]\nBleak Stars\n2 Deadly Hazards At Once\n[/list]  \n\n[h1]Equipment Visual Overhauls[/h1]\nMany unique weapons have had new improvements to their sprites and even include a new tooltip that shows off their new descriptions. As well, randomized melee weapons have new sprites and palletes to be more visually pleasing. Many throwing weapons also have a new look to them.\n\n[h1]Planet Improvements[/h1]\nAll planets now have their own unique biome spawns and dungeon spawns entirely unique to them, ones that fit the planet themselves, no longer homogenized. The biomes themselves have been improved with new looks in certain places, with new objects, plants, weathers, and even improved parallaxes on some. As well, they have their own new cave structures below the surface with new things to find.\n\n[h1]...along with multiple other reworks to the game itself.[/h1]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/YBrbbKK.png[/img]\nThere are many new additions to make the game better and make everything more unique. From new equipment to things completely unique to certain planets.\n\n[h1]New Biomes[/h1]\nThere are many new biomes added to this mod, many of which are there to make things more interesting, from planet specific cave types, to new planet types entirely, complete with their own unique spin on things. As well as new dungeons to be found on them.\n\n[list]\n    [*]1 Planet\n    [*]45 Surface Biomes\n    [*]16 Underground Biomes\n    [*]2 Dungeons\n[/list]\n\n[h1]New Resources[/h1]\nWith a progression overhaul, you bet there's a lot of new materials. Every planet has their own unique material that you can make many things with, predominantly, new pieces of equipment to speed you along to the next tier that are stronger than their base counterparts. Some even returning from beta!\n\n[list]\n    [*]11 New Ores\n    [*]1 New Monster Drop\n[/list]\n\n[h1]New Equipment[/h1]\nThere are many new pieces of equipment to keep you going along, new unique weapons, new tools. Many new things to create and find. Some crafted from materials. Some are planet specific, only can be found in a certain biome and very powerful once found.\n\n[h2]Enhancement Packs[/h2]\nThere are even new kinds of equipment known as Enhancement Packs, back items that give you a myriad of powerful buffs and can even accept Augments. Many cosmetic back items have been converted into enhancement packs.\n\n[list]\n    [*]20+ New Craftable Weapons\n    [*]11 New Craftable Throwing Weapons\n    [*]10+ New Craftable Shields\n    [*]5 New Craftable Tools\n    [*]25+ Biome Unique Weapons\n    [*]4 New Unique Weapons\n    [*]10+ Enhancement Packs\n[/list]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/LkE6tHP.png[/img]\nQ: Is this compatible with Frackin' Universe?\nA: Yes, this mod has made accomodations to fit in Frackin' Universe, however, it likely won't work too well. It won't break anything though.\n\nQ: Will this mod be updated?\nA: Yes, there are many things that I want to add that I haven't yet. I will attempt to update this mod regularly with new additions that will hopefully improve the game or even make things work differently.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/1mryFt9.png[/img]\nIf you have any questions, bug reports or feedback, please direct them to my own personal discord server.
