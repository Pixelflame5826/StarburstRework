With vast biome and planet improvements, a dynamic hazard system, a ton of planet variation, new materials, new equipment, visual improvements, and more! It changes the game's progression to build up more and allow you to have more open choice about where you explore, and makes the choice more meaningful. \n\nEvery planet feels distinct with its own challenges and variations to face. Explore an improved universe with its own dangers and things to find. Awe inspiring structures and aesthetics, new and strange things you might find in it. All the way to some of the darkest places it can go. What will you find out there, you'll just have to find out.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/y9ceAoe.png[/img]\n[h1]New Hazard System[/h1]\nThe planet hazard system has been overhauled greatly, with dynamic planet scaling as you progress through the game. Planets of higher tiers become more hazardous and not just in enemy scaling. However, you have a savior. With the new Hazard Lab Table and found around the universe, there are objects, consumables, food, and augments to help you while you build up towards EPPs. You can even go without protection and still survive if you can handle the effects they bring.\n\n[h2]New Hazards[/h2]\nMany hazards have been added to give better variety to what you might face. All old hazards have been reworked to be more survivable. Mild versions of all hazards have been implemented to planets starting at Tier 3. As well, 2 new hazard types have been added: Toxicity and Static. Both have unique ways of keeping you on your toes.\n\n[h2]Hazardous Weather[/h2]\nMany weather patterns have been changed and added to become hazardous. These weather patterns give you Mild versions of the hazards they belong to and start as early as Tier 2. They aren't too dangerous, they last only for a little while and taking shelter blocks them entirely without any hazard mitigation. Take shelter!\n\n[h1]New Progression System[/h1]\nProgression as a whole has been greatly overhauled, with new hazards, reworked stars, and planets shifted around to better fit each one and their theming. The variety of hazards found on new planets allows more open and dynamic progression that helps build up difficulty as you progress through the game. Granting you more options as the game goes on!\n[list]\n    [*][b]Tier 1-2[/b]\nGentle Stars\nNone/Hazardous Weather\n    [*][b]Tier 3[/b]\nTemperate Stars\nMild Hazards\n    [*][b]Tier 4[/b]\nHazardous Stars\nDeadly Toxicity and Radiation\n    [*][b]Tier 5[/b]\nChaotic Stars\nDeadly Heat, Cold, and Static\n    [*][b]Tier 6[/b]\nBleak Stars\n2 Deadly Hazards At Once\n[/list]  \n\n[h1]Visual Overhauls[/h1]\nMany weapons and items have had new improvements to their sprites and all equipment even includes a new tooltips that shows off new info. Such as their descriptions, the durability of mining tools, stats of weapons such as boomerangs and throwing weapons. As well, many sometimes forgotten things, such as randomized weapons and throwing weapons have new sprites to be more visually pleasing.\n\n[h1]Planet Improvements[/h1]\nAll planets now have their own unique biome spawns and dungeon spawns entirely unique to them, ones that fit the planet themselves, no longer homogenized. The biomes themselves have been improved with new looks in certain places, with new objects, plants, weathers, and even improved parallaxes on some. As well, they have their own new cave structures below the surface with new things to find.\n\n[h1]...along with multiple other reworks to the game itself.[/h1]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/YBrbbKK.png[/img]\nThere are many new additions to make the game better and make everything more unique. From new equipment to things completely unique to certain planets.\n\n[h1]New Biomes[/h1]\nThere are many new biomes added to this mod, new planets, new minibiomes, planet specific cave systems, and even the numerous amounts of planetary variants. Vast, flat fields, tall mountain ranges that challenge your climbing skills, storming environments bringing hazards with them, beautiful plant filled gardens, and caves of all kinds.\n\n[list]\n    [*]1 Planet\n    [*]46 Surface Biomes\n    [*]16 Underground Biomes\n    [*]2 Dungeons\n[/list]\n\n[h1]New Resources[/h1]\nWith a progression overhaul, you bet there's a lot of new materials. Every planet has their own unique material that you can make many things with, predominantly, new pieces of equipment to speed you along to the next tier that are stronger than their base counterparts. Some even returning from beta!\n\n[list]\n    [*]11 New Ores\n    [*]1 New Monster Drop\n[/list]\n\n[h1]New Equipment[/h1]\nThere are many new pieces of equipment to keep you going along, new unique weapons, new tools, new throwing weapons and even. Many new things to create and find. Ancient weapons once wielded by people long past, strangely engineered weapons. Create new weapons of bleeding Rubite, shadowy Erebium, and sharp Heartwood.\n[list]\n    [*]20+ New Craftable Weapons\n    [*]11 New Craftable Throwing Weapons\n    [*]10+ New Craftable Shields\n    [*]5 New Craftable Tools\n    [*]25+ Biome Unique Weapons\n    [*]4 New Unique Weapons\n    [*]10+ Enhancement Packs\n[/list]\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/LkE6tHP.png[/img]\nQ: Is this compatible with Frackin' Universe?\nA: Yes, this mod has made accomodations to fit in Frackin' Universe, however, it likely won't work too well. It won't break anything though.\n\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/1mryFt9.png[/img]\nIf you have any questions, bug reports or feedback, please direct them to my own personal discord server or the steam discussions.
