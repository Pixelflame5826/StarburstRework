--- ITEM CHANGES
+ Orange Stims are now craftable from the Medical Station.

+ Leaf/Floran Shield can now be obtained from Forest Biome chests.

+ Frost Shield can now be obtained from Snow and Tundra Biome chests.

- Orange Stims can no longer be found in PGI chests.

--- FIXES/COMPATIBILITY
+ Added a few testing operations to the Coralcreep Curry, Spicy Feathercrown, and Spicy Ribs patches as there was a mod conflict.

+ Added further testing operations to the cockpit.config patch, hopefully adding further robustness to the patches.

+ Added PGI chest spawns to the "Oceanic World Caves Reworked" Ocean and Toxic biome patches, so they should spawn. Especially if you're using the complete replacement mod.
