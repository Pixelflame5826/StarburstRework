+ Bamboo block renamed to Bamboo Panel and sprite improved to match new bamboo.

+ Changed Bamboo Panel Recipe to only include Bamboo Stalk.

+ Slightly changed the Crystal Block default color to look a bit more like quartz, and fit the backround more. The blue is still there when painted.

+ Sprites for the Biome Augments have been updated with the other augments.

+ Flipped sprite for the Chronium Bar, because it looked wierd alongside the other tiered ores.


--- OBJECT CHANGES
+ Bamboo Door now given a new and improved sprite.

+ Art pieces can now be randomly found in normal chests.

- Art pieces no longer show up in Perfectly Generic Chests.

- Reduced item spawns inside Perfectly Generic Chests. Otherworldly Weapons are untouched.


--- BIOME CHANGES 
+ Lush planets now have new weather patterns, some variants even have snow!

+ Bamboo now spawns in Forest, Jungle, and sometimes Ocean worlds.

+ Halite can be found in underground deserts and ocean biomes.

+ Basalt can be found on the surface of Volcanic planets.

+ Slate can be found in underground Snow biomes.

+ Changed underground deserts to contain Smooth Sandstone rather than normal sandstone.

+ Added the Autotank Helmet to the item pool of Scorched City chests.

+ Changed some variants of Desert planets to contain the new Layered Sandstone block rather than the normal.

+ Poison Liquid has been given its own status effect for clarity.

+ The Cryo Burn Spray status effect now shares its name with the item.

+ Mild Heat and Chill can now mitigate Deadly Chill and Heat respectively, and are made immune to the effects by Deadly Chill and Heat. This is to make some rare weather events make sense in making cold and hot cancel out slightly.


--- MONSTER CHANGES

--- NPC CHANGES 
+ Some Deadbeat NPCs can now spawn with an Autotank Helmet.


--- DUNGEON CHANGES
+ The New Horizons Painting can now be rarely found in Human Camps.
