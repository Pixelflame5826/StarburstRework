----Ideas----

-De-homogenize every planet type with matching biomes and dungeons.

-Make new dungeons for all 7 races, maybe 1 each right now.
	*Volcanic needs new dungeons, include non-flammable buildings.

-Limit microdungeons on every planet?

-Ocean minibiomes?
	*Aquatic Versions of existing minibiomes.

-Make land versions of ocean biomes?

-Give oceans landmasses via biomes?
	*Need to test.

-New ship encounters?

-More encounter dungeons.

----Probably Not----

-Make instanceworlds that represent every race.

-More penguin stuff.

-Overhaul the outpost into a living city. (Maybe Later, patches would be rediculous.)
